### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
In the company's early days, its mission was twofold: tackling scientific challenges while keeping things fun. They initially created an AI Tamagotchi, like a chatbot meets GPT, with a strong emphasis on entertainment. This was a time when digital assistants like Siri and Alexa were primarily focused on productivity, but they believed the potential for AI was much broader.

Their journey began thanks to Thomas Wolf, one of the co-founders. He started by porting Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúBirds‚Äù to PyTorch over one weekend. When he released it on GitHub, it gained a surprising amount of attention, propelling them into the world of AI. They expanded the repository with more models, and a thriving community formed around it, making it one of the most popular GitHub repositories for AI. This pivotal moment transitioned them from their initial idea to where they are now.

Their focus then expanded beyond text, venturing into other AI possibilities, leading to the creation of a thriving open AI platform that has become central to NLP and ML applications.

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Hugging Face focuses on two main directions:
1. **AI Beyond Text**: They aim to expand beyond text, which has been heavily used on their platform, to include text-to-image and text-to-video models. They are exploring time series models for financial predictions and other AI applications.
2. **Democratizing AI**: Historically, AI platforms were designed for machine learning engineers, but Hugging Face is making it more accessible to a broader audience. Their goal is to reduce the barriers to entry so that everyone can use and open source to train their own models.
